=head1 NAME

Devel::AssertOS::OSFeatures::SupportsSiebel - Perl extension to test if an OS is supported by Siebel CRM

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Devel::AssertOS::OSFeatures::SupportsSiebel;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module checks, by just importing it, if the OS running the code is supported by Siebel or not. If not, the module will C<die>, 
forcing the code to stop being executed.

This module was proposed by David Cantrell in L<http://www.mail-archive.com/cpan-testers-discuss%40perl.org/msg03089.html>.

=head2 EXPORT

None, but the functions below can be used by calling them with the complete package name (Devel::AssertOS::OSFeatures::SupportsSiebel::<function>).

=head3 matches

Returns a list of the OS that are supported by Siebel CRM.

It will execute C<os_is> with the operational system name, calling C<die_unsuported> if the return value from C<os_is> is false.

Beware that the given parameter must follow the same provided by $^O, including case and format.
C<die_if_os_isnt> is called by default when the module is imported to another package.

=head1 CAVEATS

Beware that Siebel is supported by specific versions of OS. This module does not check OS version.
