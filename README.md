# Siebel GNU Tools

This project hosts several small programs (most of them scripts) that were created to deal with different sysadmin categories of problems when working with Siebel applications.

A full description of the programs is available at project [wiki](https://github.com/glasswalk3r/siebel-gnu-tools/wiki).

## Where this name come from?

All these programs are short and somehow simple, but they are intended to help you troubleshoot or manage your Siebel applications easier. Since they are not complex, I don't see why keeping a separated project for each one of them.

Besides, all this code is available under the GNU GPL version 3 license. That's why the "GNU" in the name.
